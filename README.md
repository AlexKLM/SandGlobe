C++/Real Time Graphics ACW

This is a project I have done for the courses C++ Programming and Design combined with Real Time Graphics at the University of Hull. 

The objective of the project is to demonstrate on how to design and create C++ program that has a good class design and is efficient, and also implement the technique we have learnt in Real Time Graphics. 

For some reason the program cannot be built in Release mode anymore(which would be faster), I am currently looking into it and hoping to fixed it soon.
